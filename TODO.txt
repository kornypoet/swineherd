* The next task in a workflow should NOT run if the previous step failed
** this is made difficult by the fact that, sometimes?, when a pig script fails it still returns a 0 exit status
** same for wukong scripts
* Add a @job@ object that implements a @not_if@ function. this way a @workflow@ will be constructed of @job@ objects
** a @job@ will do nothing more than execute the ruby code in it's (run?) block, unless @not_if@ is true
** this way we can put @script@ objects inside a @job@ and only run under certain conditions that the user specifies when
   they create the @job@
* Implement FTP filesystem interface
